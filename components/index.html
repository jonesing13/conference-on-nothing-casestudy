				We aim to show you nothing. One night as a result of yearlong unique dialog between professional artists and scientists. A conference that went out of control. Let us drag you into the void. Let's set new cosmological orders, new beginnings. Contemporary art and natural science meet each other on the grounds of sharing and learning. Come to chat, play, and party with us.

					<h3>Artists</h3>
					<p>
						A group of artists with a mixture of specializations, including sculpture, photography, architecture, fine arts, literature and computer graphics. They all meet at interdisciplinary performances in a challenging environment far from everyday galleries. In collaboration with the scientists, they developed the main conference contributions, the installations, and the event's gradation and form.

						A line-up of external artists that will ignite the night party in the main room from the stage, i.e. the infinite coffee break once the nothing is achieved, being the main conference goal. The sonic representations of new patterns emerging from the void through carefully chosen programming are accompanied at first by visuals from the core group of artists who take over the decor in the main room, as well as the SALO lounge.

						A group of natural scientists with a mixture of expertise, including cosmology, quantum physics, astronomy, biophysics, and history of science. They all helped to develop the artworks shown, and they equally contribute to the conference program alongside the core group of artists. Working everyday with natural phenomena, they are guides to the corners of the universe and human knowledge.

									Aleksandra Vajd is a Prague-based Slovenian artist and currently runs the Studio Of Photography at the Academy of Arts, Architecture and Design (AAAD) and is an assistant professor at the Academy of Visual Arts in Ljubljana where she teaches seminar on Theory and practice of Photographic medium. In her art practice, Aleksandra explores the medium of photography and pushes at its limitations. She works with the image as an object, she makes use of space, and she is interested in the materiality of light. Her individual works of art or collaborative projects have been presented in e.g. Galerie Rudolfinum in Prague, Cukrarna in Ljubljana, the Astrup Fearnley Museet in Oslo, Glasgow's Street Level Photoworks gallery, Museum of Modern Art Ljubljana, Prague City Gallery, Kyoto's Zuiun-an-Art Project Space, Museum of Contemporary Photography in Chicago, the City Gallery in Ljubljana or the &#x3c; rotor &#x3e; centre for contemporary art in Graz. Vajd has also participated in several photographic festivals and biennales, including the Photo Festival in Krakow, Leipzig, Liège, and the 9th Triennale of Contemporary Art U3 in Ljubljana. In recent years, she has shifted her focus to reductive photographic work, exploring the borders of the medium with particular emphasis on its materiality and its scale.

									Anetta Mona Chişa is currently based at the Academy of Fine Arts in Prague. Her artistic practice usually takes place under the form of dialogues and collaborative working, exploring performative materialities of environments and technologies, their poetics and politics. The artist is attuned to the idea of shifting systems of reference, of the necessity of change and adaptive reasoning to a world whose boundaries are more and more constrained to an idea of the market, of capitalist axioms and an almost mystical digitalization. Her individual works and collaborative projects were exhibited in The 8th Floor in New York, n.b.k. in Berlin, Galerie Rudolfinum Prague, Cukrarna in Ljubljana, Gesellschaft für Aktuelle Kunst Bremen, Lunds Konsthall, MoCA Miami, Kunstraum Niederösterreich in Vienna, Haifa Museum of Art, The Power Plant in Toronto, the Taipei Biennale, Schirn Kunsthalle Frankfurt, the Moscow Biennale, or the Venice Biennale, among others.

									Vojtěch Radakulan works in the fields of fine arts, architecture, and interactive computer graphics, investigating these in both an artistic and scientific way. He examines the world by reconstruciting it in a process of world building. His tools span from hand drawings, text, physical installations, game engines, rendering software, or psychophysics. In his reflections of the world, visitors can try to become something or someone else, see complicated topics like new technologies, asymmetric relationships, or globalization issues from a perspective of another human, computer, or a pine cone. He took part in exhibitions like Venice architecture Bienniale (2021), Ars Electronica (2018), and received the Jindřich Chalupecký Award (2022). He has a master degree in sculpture and architecture. Currently he is a PhD candidate at CTU FEL at the department of computer graphics and interaction and teaches at FAMU CAS.

Amidst crumpled hints and cryptic symbols, chance entanglements offer glimpses into clandestine exchanges of creativity and wisdom.
